Through lectures, discussions, and \nlots of hands-on activities\n with experienced OSG staff,\nyou will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific\ncomputing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help.  Take a look at \nthe high-level curriculum and\nsyllabus\n for more details.\n\n\nThe school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part\nof the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students,\nfaculty, and staff.  Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs\nassociated with the School.\n\n\nApplications\n\n\nApplications are now open.  \nThe deadline for applications is Friday, 12 April 2019.\n  Submit your application soon to\nensure consideration!\n\n\nTo apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete the \nonline application form\n (link goes to vdt.cs.wisc.edu website,\n  which hosts the application)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave someone email a letter of recommendation for you to\n  \nuser-school@opensciencegrid.org\n (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF\n  or plain text best)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally\n ideally a faculty member or\nother supervisor.  They should clearly identify your name and the \u201cOSG User School 2019\u201d in the subject line and letter,\nso that we can associate your application and letter.\n\n\nIdeal candidates will:\n\n\n\n\nBe graduate students doing research or support staff helping researchers (but see below)\n\n\nNeed large amounts of computing, which could transform research or open new paths to discovery\n\n\nHave basic experience with the Linux command line (or learn beforehand)\n\n\nBe available to travel to Madison for the School dates (foreign students, check your passport and visa now!)\n\n\n\n\nNot a graduate student or support staff?\n We consider applications from advanced undergraduates, especially those who\nare involved in graduate-level research or coursework; make a strong case for yourself!  Also, we consider other groups\n(post-doctoral students, faculty, researchers, other staff, etc.), especially if you convince us that this opportunity\nis likely to have a significant effect on your work or research, or that of others.\n\n\nSpread the Word\n\n\nPlease tell people who may be interested in the School about us.

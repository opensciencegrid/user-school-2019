<p>Whether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, please make sure that we get a copy of your travel plans so that we
know when to expect you here and can plan accurately.  (If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will make a room
reservation and pay for the six nights of the schedule.)</p>
<p>Find the numbered section below that applies to you:</p>
<h2 id="1-we-offered-to-pay-for-your-travel">1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel<a class="headerlink" href="#1-we-offered-to-pay-for-your-travel" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Our goal is to find reasonable and comfortable travel options for you to come to Madison and return home.  At the same
time, we must stay within our budget and follow all University of Wisconsin rules about arranging and paying for your
travel costs.  So let&rsquo;s work together to find something that makes sense for everyone.</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas that have worked in the past to help some School travelers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are less than 300 miles from Madison, consider driving; we can reimburse mileage and tolls up to a point.  Or
  look into bus routes, especially from larger cities like Chicago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you fly, it may be much cheaper to fly to Milwaukee (1&frac12; hours away) or Chicago (2&frac12; hours away), then
  take a direct bus to Madison.  The buses are very comfortable, have wi-fi, and run frequently.  See below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also if you fly, be flexible about departure times — early and late flights are often the least expensive.  Now we do
  not like very early or very late flights any more than you do, so we will work hard to find reasonable flight times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please try to complete your travel plans by mid-June, before rates go up significantly.</p>

<p><span style="color: #FF6600;">Do NOT buy your own airline tickets</span>.  University rules require that our travel
agency, Fox World Travel (FWT), purchases your tickets.</p>
<p>Use the following information to get air travel tickets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gather your travel information: full legal name (as it is written on government IDs), date of birth, phone number;
  travel dates and starting/ending location(s); and any travel preferences.  Then, contact Fox World Travel directly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By email:</strong> send to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#117;&#119;&#103;&#114;&#111;&#117;&#112;&#115;&#64;&#102;&#111;&#120;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#108;&#100;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#117;&#119;&#103;&#114;&#111;&#117;&#112;&#115;&#64;&#102;&#111;&#120;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#108;&#100;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> and include your name (e.g., &ldquo;T. Cartwright&rdquo;) and
  <span style="color: #FF6600;">Group Code 09UW3749</span> in the subject line.</li>
<li><strong>By phone:</strong> From the U.S., call 866-230-8787 toll free, or internationally, call +1&nbsp;920-230-6467.  Select
  option 4, and tell them you are using <span style="color: #FF6600;">Group Code 09UW3749</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must review and approve <em>most</em> trips.  FWT is authorized to purchase tickets directly only in the easiest cases.
  But if the FWT agent says that your trip must be reviewed, do not worry!  It just means that we need to check our
  budget, make sure that we have considered all reasonable options, and are following all University rules.  Hopefully
  we can approve your first choice, otherwise we will work with you and FWT to find one or more reasonable options.
  Some common reasons for a trip needing review are: total trip cost over $475, travel starting and ending at different
  locations, and travel on dates other than July 14 and 20.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval takes time, so it may take up to a day to get final confirmation.  Airplane tickets cannot be held without
  purchase over a weekend, so it is best to avoid contacting FWT late on Fridays.  Also note that FWT and
  UW&ndash;Madison are closed on Monday, May 27, for Memorial Day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please be considerate of the FWT agent(s) you work with.  They work hard to find good options for you, but they must
  also follow our rules.  If you feel that they are not providing the options that you want, you should email us.  We
  will try to understand the options that you want and that FWT is providing, and help resolve any issues.  Do not argue
  with the FWT agents, especially about options you find online&nbsp;&mdash; there are many reasons why that option
  might not be available to us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="travel-by-bus">Travel by Bus<a class="headerlink" href="#travel-by-bus" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>For some nearby locations, or in addition to air travel to Chicago or Milwaukee, it may be helpful to take a bus to
Madison.  Bus companies that School travelers have used a great deal in the past are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.govangalder.com/Schedule/TimeSchedule">Van Galder Bus</a>, especially from Chicago</li>
<li><a href="https://badgerbus.com/">Badger Bus</a>, especially from Milwaukee</li>
</ul>
<p>You may purchase bus tickets through Fox World Travel (FWT):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By email:</strong> send to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#117;&#119;&#103;&#114;&#111;&#117;&#112;&#115;&#64;&#102;&#111;&#120;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#108;&#100;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#117;&#119;&#103;&#114;&#111;&#117;&#112;&#115;&#64;&#102;&#111;&#120;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#108;&#100;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> and include your name (e.g., &ldquo;T. Cartwright&rdquo;) and
  <span style="color: #FF6600;">Group Code 09UW3749</span> in the subject line.</li>
<li><strong>By phone:</strong> From the U.S., call 866-230-8787 toll free, or internationally, call +1&nbsp;920-230-6467.  Select
  option 4, and tell them you are using <span style="color: #FF6600;">Group Code 09UW3749</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Or for maximum flexibility, you may purchase bus tickets yourself <strong>before or on</strong> the day of travel.  If you purchase
your own tickets, you must get our approval for the estimated cost first, then request reimbursement from us after the
School.</p>
<p>If you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email).  It is best to have a detailed receipt
(including your name, itinerary, date of purchase, and total amount paid), but a regular ticket stub (e.g., without your
name or date) should work fine.  Just get what you can!</p>
<p>Be sure to email us with your bus plans, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)</li>
<li>Arrival date and approximate time</li>
<li>Departure date and approximate time</li>
<li>Arrival and departure location within Madison</li>
<li>Actual or estimated cost (indicate which)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="travel-by-personal-car">Travel by Personal Car<a class="headerlink" href="#travel-by-personal-car" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you are driving to Madison, you will be reimbursed the mileage rate of $0.58 per mile for the shortest round-trip
distance (as calculated by Google Maps), plus tolls.  Also, we will pay for parking costs for the week at the hotel in
Madison (but not elsewhere).  We recommend keeping your receipts for tolls.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option!  We reserve the right to limit
your total driving reimbursement, so work with us on the details.</strong></p>
<p>To travel by personal car, please check with us first.  We may search for comparable flight options, to make sure that
driving is indeed the least expensive method.</p>
<p>Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible.  Try to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Departure date from home, location (for mileage calculation), and approximate time of arrival in Madison</li>
<li>Departure date and approximate time from Madison, and return location (for mileage calculation) if different than above</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-you-are-paying-for-your-travel">2. You Are Paying for Your Travel<a class="headerlink" href="#2-you-are-paying-for-your-travel" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you are paying for your own travel or if someone else is paying for it, go ahead and make your travel arrangements
now!  Just remember to arrive on Sunday, July 14, before 6pm and depart on Saturday, July 20 (or else check with us
first).</p>
<p>Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible.  Try to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation provider(s) (e.g., airline)</li>
<li>Arrival date and approximate time</li>
<li>Departure date and approximate time</li>
<li>Arrival and departure location within Madison (e.g., airport, bus station, etc.)</li>

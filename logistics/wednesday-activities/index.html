<p>After Wednesday morning instruction and lunch, there are no required instructional activities.  Therefore, you are free
to explore Madison, rest, or stick around and talk to instructors or work on your projects.</p>
<p>Please note that <em>School-Organized Activities</em> are all free and walkable.  If you are interested in the <em>On Your Own</em>
activities also listed, or prefer not to walk, you will be responsible for you own transportation costs and activity
costs.  We cannot reimburse transportation costs for these Wednesday afternoon activities.</p>
<h2 id="school-organized-activities">School-Organized Activities<a class="headerlink" href="#school-organized-activities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>After lunch, select School instructors will accompany interested students for the below activities, which are all free
and walkable.  You are welcome to arrange alternative transportation, but are responsible for any transportation costs.</p>

gathering at 5 p.m.; the music starts at 7 p.m. and lasts an hour and a half to two hours.  One of the instructors
will be holding a spot on the Capitol lawn with blankets well in advance, so there should be room for many people.</p>

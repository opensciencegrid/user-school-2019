# OSG User School 2019

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison and learn how.*

During the school, July 15&ndash;19, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems&nbsp;&mdash; at your
own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG)&nbsp;&mdash; to run large-scale computing applications that are
at the heart of today&rsquo;s cutting-edge science.  Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities**
with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to
implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help.  Take a look at
[the high-level curriculum and syllabus](/curriculum/overview) for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part
of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students,
faculty, and staff.  Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs
associated with the School.

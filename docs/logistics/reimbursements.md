# Getting Reimbursed for Expenses

If you paid for certain expenses to attend the OSG User School 2019, then we will reimburse you for them.  This page
explains what can be reimbursed and how to request reimbursement.  Please read this whole page carefully before
submitting your request.

**The deadline for all reimbursement submissions is <span style="color: #FF6600;">Friday, 13 September 2019</span>.**

## What Can Be Reimbursed?

We offered to reimburse certain expenses that were part of attending the OSG School:

-   Bus fare to/from Madison
-   Taxi or ride-share to/from Madison airport
-   Driving mileage (if prearranged)
-   Dinners Monday through Thursday (up to $27 per dinner)

Generally, we are not able to reimburse you for any other expenses (e.g., checked baggage fees, transportation to/from
your home and local airport).  However, if we made specific arrangements with you before the School, those arrangements
are still valid for reimbursement.  When in doubt, contact us before the deadline.

## What Information Is Needed?

The University of Wisconsin–Madison has strict requirements about reimbursements.  See below for each type of expense
and its rules.

| Expense | Rules |
|:--------|:------|
| <p>Bus fare</p> | <p>For bus trips between Madison and a nearby airport, as planned with us in advance.</p><p>The original receipt is required, including at least the total amount paid.</p> |
| <p>Ride fare</p> | <p>For taxi and ride-sharing trips between the Madison airport and your hotel. Rides in your home town are not covered.</p><p>If you paid for other School participants, list their names. If the total (fare + tip) is more than $25, the original receipt is required, ideally including:</p><ul><li>Date of trip</li><li>Fare and tip</li></ul> |
| <p>Driving mileage</p> | <p>If we agreed in advance to cover your driving costs to/from the School, simply list the agreed-upon reimbursement amount ($ or miles) as a reminder.</p> |
| <p>Dinners</p> | <p>For dinners on Monday through Thursday of the School, we can reimburse you for up to $27 per evening.</p><ul><li>The total reimbursement per evening is limited to $27</li><li>Within the $27 total, you may include tax and tip (but no more than 20% tip)</li><li>No alcohol is allowed, but non-alcoholic drinks are OK</li><li>Original receipts are not required, but if you want to email us a scanned copy of your receipts, it may help us understand your request better</li></ul><p>If you do not have receipts, do your best to estimate your meal expenses accurately, up to the $27 per evening limit. Remember, all of your meal reimbursements are being paid by federal taxpayer funds, so be fair and honest! |

For other expense types that were arranged before the School, contact us to learn what documentation is required.

**Note:** If you must give us receipts (see above), electronic files are fine.  You may scan or photograph any paper
  receipts and email them to us.

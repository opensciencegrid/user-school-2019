# Wednesday Afternoon Options

After Wednesday morning instruction and lunch, there are no required instructional activities.  Therefore, you are free
to explore Madison, rest, or stick around and talk to instructors or work on your projects.

Please note that *School-Organized Activities* are all free and walkable.  If you are interested in the *On Your Own*
activities also listed, or prefer not to walk, you will be responsible for you own transportation costs and activity
costs.  We cannot reimburse transportation costs for these Wednesday afternoon activities.

## School-Organized Activities

After lunch, select School instructors will accompany interested students for the below activities, which are all free
and walkable.  You are welcome to arrange alternative transportation, but are responsible for any transportation costs.

-   **[UW&ndash;Madison Campus Tour](https://info.wisc.edu/campus-tours/)**

    Starting at 3 p.m., this approximately 1-hour tour will begin at Union South and end at Memorial Union.  FREE.
    Gather at the Union South information desk starting around 2:50 p.m.

-   **[Tour of Wisconsin State Capitol](http://tours.wisconsin.gov/)**

    Tours start at 1, 2, 3, and 4 p.m. and last about 45 minutes.  FREE.  <!-- An instructor will lead a group walk to
    the Capitol after the UW Campus Tour, or just meet at the Capitol main desk before the tour. -->

-   **[Concert on the Square](https://wisconsinchamberorchestra.org/performance-listing/category/concerts-on-the-square/)**

    The Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra plays classical music outdoors near the State Capitol building.  We will start
    gathering at 5 p.m.; the music starts at 7 p.m. and lasts an hour and a half to two hours.  One of the instructors
    will be holding a spot on the Capitol lawn with blankets well in advance, so there should be room for many people.

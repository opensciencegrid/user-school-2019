# Fun Things to Do in Madison

Summer is a great time to be in Madison.  Below are just a few suggestions of things to do or look into while you are
here.

-   [Memorial Union](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/memorial-union/) is a great place to hang out and a reasonable walk
    from the School hotel.  Many people like to get a drink and relax on
    [the Terrace](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/), which looks out over Lake Mendota.
    Check [the Wisconsin Union events calendar](https://union.wisc.edu/events-and-activities/event-calendar/) for more
    information.

-   State Street connects the UW&ndash;Madison campus to the State Capitol building (and the hotel), and is a
    student-friendly street and outdoor pedestrian mall with tons of great businesses — restaurants, stores, bars, and
    more.

-   Catch a show at the historic [Orpheum Theatre](http://www.madisonorpheum.com).

-   Check out the [Overture Center for the Arts](http://www.overturecenter.org/).

-   Read [The Isthumus Daily Page](https://isthmus.com/) for current events in town.

-   Go to a [free outdoor classical music “Concert on the Square” on
    Wednesday](https://wisconsinchamberorchestra.org/performance-listing/category/concerts-on-the-square), by the State
    Capitol building.

-   Check out other ideas on our page of suggestions for [Wednesday afternoon activities](wednesday-activities.md).

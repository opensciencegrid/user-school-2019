Monday Exercise 2.4: Submit with “queue from”
=============================================

The goal of this exercise is to submit many jobs from a single submit file by using the `queue ... from` syntax to read variable values from a file.

More Job Submission Alternatives
--------------------------------

In the previous exercise, we used the `queue ... matching` syntax, which is primarily useful for collections of files with similar names. But that method has its weaknesses, too. 
It is less useful when the values for different job conditions are **not** filenames, or if you have other filenames with a similar naming pattern that should *not* be used for jobs.

Queue Jobs From a List of Values
--------------------------------

Suppose we want to modify our word-frequency analysis a little bit so that it outputs only the most common *N* words of a document. Further, we want to experiment with different values of *N*. And finally, even though we downloaded it, we no longer want to analyze the Sherlock Holmes stories in the `TAoSH.txt` file. Clearly, `queue ... matching` will not help us in this case.

First, we need a new version of the word counting program so that it accepts an extra number as a command line argument and outputs only that many of the most common words. Here is the new code (it's still not important that you understand this code):

``` file
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import sys
import operator

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print 'Usage: %s DATA NUM_WORDS' % (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))
    sys.exit(1)
input_filename = sys.argv[1]
num_words = int(sys.argv[2])

words = {}

my_file = open(input_filename, 'r')
for line in my_file:
    line_words = line.split()
    for word in line_words:
        if word in words:
            words[word] += 1
        else:
            words[word] = 1
my_file.close()

sorted_words = sorted(words.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))
for word in sorted_words[-num_words:]:
    print '%s %8d' % (word[0], word[1])
```

To submit this program with a collection of two variable values for each run, one for the number of top words and one for the filename:

1.  In the same directory as the last exercise, save the script as `wordcount-top-n.py`.
1.  Copy your submit file from the last exercise to a new name (maybe `wordcount-top.sub`).
1.  Update the `executable` and `log` statements as appropriate.
1.  Update other statements to work with two variables, `book` and `n`:

        :::file
        output = $(book)_top_$(n).out 
        error = $(book)_top_$(n).err 
        transfer_input_files = $(book) 
        arguments = "$(book) $(n)" 
        queue book,n from books_n.txt

    Note especially the changes to the `queue` statement; it now tells HTCondor to read a separate text file of ***pairs*** of values, which will be assigned to `book` and `n` respectively.

1.  Create the separate text file of job variable values and save it as `books_n.txt`:

        :::file
        AAiW.txt, 10 
        AAiW.txt, 25 
        AAiW.txt, 50 
        PandP.txt, 10 
        PandP.txt, 25 
        PandP.txt, 50

    Note that we used 3 different values for *n* for each book, and that we dropped the Sherlock Holmes book, `TAoSH.txt`.

1.  Submit the file
1.  Do a quick sanity check: How many jobs were submitted? How many log, output, and error files were created?

Extra Challenge 1
-----------------

Between this exercise and the previous one, you have explored two of the three primary `queue` statements. How would you use the `queue in ... list` statement to accomplish the same thing(s) as one or both of the exercises?

Extra Challenge 2
-----------------

You may have noticed that the output of these jobs has a messy naming convention. Because our macros resolve to the filenames, including their extension (e.g., `AAiW.txt`), the output filenames contain with multiple extensions (e.g., `AAiW.txt.err`). Although the extra extension is acceptable, it makes the filenames harder to read and possibly organize. *Change your submit file and variable file for this exercise so that the output filenames do not include the `.txt` extension.*
